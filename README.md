## Contribution

I welcome feedback, and pull requests. If there's something that you need to change in the library, please log an issue, and explain the problem. If you have a proposed solution, please write it up and explain why you think it is the answer to the problem. The best way to highlight a bug is to submit a pull request with a unit test that fails so I can clearly see what the problem is in the first place.

### Pull Requests

Please break pull requests up in to their smallest possible parts. If you have a small feature of refactor that other code depends on, try submitting that first. Please try to reference an issue so that I understand the context of the pull request. If there is no issue, I don't know what the code is about. If you need help, please jump on Slack here: https://hardwarewallets.slack.com

## Donate

All Hardwarewallets.Net libraries are open source and free. Your donations will contribute to making sure that these libraries keep up with the latest hardwarewallet firmware, functions are implemented, and the quality is maintained.
